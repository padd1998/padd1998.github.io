<p> I'm a big fan of rugby, Brazilian jiu jitsu and boxing. I played rugby for ten years, I've been doing jiu jitsu for about a year now. I've dabbled in a bit of boxing, but I'm far too pretty to be carrying on. </p>

<p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a self-defence martial art and combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting and submission holds. Jiu-Jitsu teaches chokes and submissions. A good practitioner has a choke for a wide variety of positions, and is able to innovate and improvise. It is a collection of skills that can be improved upon for years and decades, people who have been training for decades are still learning techniques and improving their game. </p>
