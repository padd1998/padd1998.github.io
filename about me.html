    <p>I'm a recent graduate who wants to go into tech. I went to Swansea University and studied Aerospace Engineering there. I enjoyed the puzzle solving aspect of it but ultimately, I don't have much interest in the physical machinary and products in the industry. Especially, I don't like the idea that so much of it is used for warfare and killing people. I'm looking to go into coding because of the puzzle solving aspect, and the productive aspect: you're actually creating something tangible on a screen, if not physically tangible. </p>
